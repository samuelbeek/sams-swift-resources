# Sams Swift Resources

This is an attempt to share more knowledge. An organized list of all the stuff that I learn my iOS programming skills from. Note: most of this is about Swift, because I mostly prorgram in that language.

* [Undirectional Data Flow in Swift](https://realm.io/news/benji-encz-unidirectional-data-flow-swift/)

### Gists 
I'm a big fan of Gists, they're underated. It's a great way to share stuff that's to *rough* for being a dependency, but can still be very usefull for others. All of these are in Swift.
